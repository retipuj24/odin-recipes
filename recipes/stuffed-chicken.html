        <ul>
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">2 cups finely chopped broccoli florets</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">½ cup shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">4 small button mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">4 large chicken breasts</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">1 teaspoon paprika</li>    
            <li><img src="images/arrow-15x11.png" alt="arrow-bullets">salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine broccoli and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave on high power for 2 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine cooked broccoli, pepperjack cheese, mayonnaise, mushrooms, and garlic powder in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Season both sides of each chicken breast with paprika, salt, and pepper. Use a sharp knife to cut a slice through the middle of each breast to create a deep pocket, making sure not to cut all the way through. Evenly stuff each breast with broccoli mixture and place on the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
