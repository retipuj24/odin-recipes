    <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Chicken stuffed with a cheesy broccoli and mushroom filling. Serve with a salad and roasted potatoes for a complete and satisfying meal.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups finely chopped broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>4 small button mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 large chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>    
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine broccoli and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave on high power for 2 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine cooked broccoli, pepperjack cheese, mayonnaise, mushrooms, and garlic powder in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Season both sides of each chicken breast with paprika, salt, and pepper. Use a sharp knife to cut a slice through the middle of each breast to create a deep pocket, making sure not to cut all the way through. Evenly stuff each breast with broccoli mixture and place on the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
